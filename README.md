# Monster Game using React

This is a web-based game heavily inspired by the Chao Garden mini-game from the Sonic Adventure series, along with other pet battler games. In this game, players can raise, interact with, and care for virtual pets, which they can also pit against other AI-controlled opponents for various rewards. This project serves as a demonstration of my full-stack web development skills.
